Hi,

I am in a meeting with a new vendor and I need you to process an urgent wire transfer immediately to secure the contract. 
This is confidential and needs to be done within the next hour.

Please verify the invoice attachment and send the payment to the account details listed.
Do not discuss this with anyone else until I return.

Regards,
John Smith
CEO
