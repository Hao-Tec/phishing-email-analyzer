Hi everyone,

We are planning a team lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM to celebrate the recent release.
We're thinking of going to the new Italian place around the corner.

Let me know if you can make it so I can book a table.
Also, please check your dietary preferences on the spreadsheet if anything has changed.

Cheers,
Sarah
Team Lead
